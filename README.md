### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs prepared me to complete the assignment. I was able to complete the assignment because I had a good understanding of the topics discussed in the labs.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I would have added more features to the website. I would have added a feature where the user can add a gif to the board. I would have also added a feature where the user can add a gif to the card. I would have also added a feature where the user can add a gif to the comment.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Next time I will try to use the stretch features and make the website more interactive. I will also try to make the website more responsive and make it look better.
